# SheffyBot

This is a Discord bot that simulates the gachapon system on Princess Connect Re:Dive game. It basically serves as a gachapon reliever for the people who get washed up from playing the actual gachapon in-game or for the people who wants to test their luck before playing it real.

This bot is using the DiscordJS API that allows the users to play it through the slash commands. Therefore, this bot is implemented with JavaScript, which is obvious from self-explanatory with the word "DiscordJS".

This bot is simple to launch it on your own. It basically needs your discord server and channel tokens, where you want to deploy your bot in. Unfortunately, I do not know how to make this bot to follow multiple users' commands at once. Hence, I make a 10 seconds delay for each command executed, which included to allow the gif (Karin running animation) to run within that time period and allow the functions to executes and returns the gachapon results at the end.
